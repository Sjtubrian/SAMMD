# Maximum Mean Discrepancy Test is Aware of Adversarial Attacks
Hi, this is the pytorch code for Semantic-Aware Maximum Mean Discrepancy Test, presented in the ICML2021 paper " Maximum Mean Discrepancy Test is Aware of Adversarial Attacks" (http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11415). This work is done by

# Software
We recommend users to install python via Anaconda (python 3.7.3), which can be downloaded from https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section.  

Most codes require freqopttest repo (interpretable nonparametric two-sample test) to implement ME and SCF tests, which can be installed by  
```
pip install git+https://github.com/wittawatj/interpretable-test
```
Torch: 1.1.0  

Python: 3.7.3  

CUDA: 10.1  

# Obtain adversarial data
SAMMD Test can help practitioners to detect adversarial or mixed data generated by any methods.  

We provide some examples of generating adversarial data in the adv folder.  

The CIFAR-10 dataset and the SVHN dataset can be downloaded via Pytorch.  

1) run
```
python train_model.py
```

2) run  
```
python adv_generator.py  
```
you can obtain adversarial data by FGSM, BIM, PGD and CW attack method.

We also provide some exampled trained models and adversarial data. Please download it:

# Baselines
- MMD-G: MMD with a Gaussian kernel;  

- MMD-O: MMD with a bandwidth optimized Gaussian kernel;  

- MMDâˆ’D: MMD wth a deep kernel;  

- Mean embedding (ME): a test based on differences in Gaussian kernel mean embeddings at a set of optimized points;  

- Smooth characteristic functions (SCF): a test based on differences in Gaussian mean embeddings at a set of optimized frequencies;  

- Classifier two-sample test (C2ST): a special case of MMD, including C2STS-S and C2ST-L;  

run  
```
python Baselines.py  
```
you can obtain average test power of MMD-G, MMD-O, MMD-D, ME, SCF, C2ST-S and C2ST-L Test;  


# Semantic-Aware Maximum Mean Discrepancy (SAMMD) Test
run  
```
python SAMMD_Test.py  
```
you can obtain average test power of SAMMD Test;
